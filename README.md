OneUI Launcher Mods is a **root** app for Android 12+ that enables you to add a number of features to the stock
OneUI Launcher, without needing Xposed.

- Custom icons, including icon packs, adaptive icon packs and Lawnicons
- Custom themed icons, add themed icons to apps that don't yet have them officially
  - Generate themed icons from supported normal icons
- Replace the At a Glance **or** Search Box with a widget of your choice
- Hide apps from the app drawer
- Resize widgets beyond their original bounds, down to 1x1 or up to the maximum size of your grid
- Hide the status bar clock while the OneUI Launcher is visible, for ultimate minimalism
